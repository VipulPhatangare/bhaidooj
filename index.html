                        Words can never truly express what you mean to me. You're not just my sister — 
                        you're my first friend, my protector, my confidant. When the world felt heavy, 
                        you were the one who made everything lighter.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In my darkest moments, when I couldn't find my way, you were the light that 
                        guided me home. You understood my silence, you felt my pain, and you stood by me 
                        without hesitation. That kind of love is rare, and I'm blessed to call you my sister.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On this special day of <strong>Bhai Dooj</strong>, I want you to know how deeply 
                        grateful I am for everything you've done for me. This sacred thread is a promise — 
                        that I'll always be there for you, just as you've been there for me.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        May life shower you with all the joy you deserve. May your dreams take flight, 
                        may your heart always be at peace, and may that beautiful smile never fade. 
                        You've given me so much, and I pray that the universe gives you everything your 
                        heart desires. You deserve the world and more. 🌟
